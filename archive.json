      "body": "While the Operator Audit Module lets the Human Operator get an oversight of the LLM Decision with a corresponding Confidence Score, it is also important to include the Explainability (with counterfactual reasoning) aspect along with the Confidence Score.\n\nI propose the following 3 key aspects of the Explainability functionality.\n\n1. **Decision Breakdown**: Each LLM-generated configuration should include a breakdown of key influencing factors. For example, the LLM Decision may also contain \"This configuration was suggested due to high network congestion detected in Telemetry Data\".\n\n2. **Justification Logs**: Extend audit records to include decision rationales alongside confidence scores. For example:\n    - **Decision**: Increase bandwidth allocation\n    - **Confidence Score**: 85%\n    - **Key Factors**: High latency in telemetry, SLA violation threshold crossed\n\n3. **Counterfactual Analysis**: The system should simulate \u201cWhat if?\u201d scenarios\nFor example, \"If no changes are made, network congestion will increase by 15% in the next 5 minutes\".\n\nPlease review and let me know if I can raise a PR to extend the current Operator Audit Module by adding the above-mentioned Explainability functionality. Thanks!",

That'll provide a more reliable confidence scoring, and a better simulation scenario.

          "body": "@xmzzyo  - thanks for the idea of integration. I support the integration idea and here's why:\n\n1. The **Counterfactual Analysis just becomes more accurate**. Instead of simply predicting, \u201cIf no changes are made, congestion will increase by 15%,\u201d the Digital Twin can simulate the actual network behavior under different conditions before any real-world application.\n2. Once validated by the Network Digital Twin, the **confidence score is now based on realistic network dynamics rather than purely model-driven assumptions**.\n3. The integration provides an **Automated Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement.**\n\nDo you think we need a separate draft for the integration? or should we work on extending the current draft with the integration elements?",
