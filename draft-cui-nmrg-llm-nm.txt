1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   Traditional network automation systems often face challenges in
   handling unanticipated scenarios and managing complex multi-domain
   data dependencies.  Large Language Models (LLMs) offer advanced
   multimodal data comprehension, adaptive reasoning, and generalization
   capabilities, making them a promising tool for network management and
   autonomous network[TM-IG1230].  However, full automation remains
   impractical due to risks such as model hallucination, operational
   errors, and a lack of accountability in decision-making[Huang25].
   This document proposes a structured framework that integrates LLMs
   into network management through human-in-the-loop collaboration,
   leveraging their strengths while ensuring oversight, reliability, and
   operational safety.

1.2.  Problem Statement

   Network management faces significant challenges, including the
   complexity of multi-vendor configurations, the real-time correlation
   of heterogeneous telemetry data, and the need for rapid responses to
   dynamic security threats.  LLMs offer a promising approach to
   addressing these challenges through their advanced multimodal data
   understanding and adaptive reasoning capabilities.  However, the
   direct application of LLMs in network management introduces several
   technical considerations.  These include the need for semantic
   enrichment of network telemetry to enhance LLM comprehension, a dual-
   channel decision execution mechanism with confidence-based
   escalation, and auditability of LLM-generated decisions through
   provenance tracking.  Addressing these requirements is critical to
   integrating LLMs effectively into network management workflows while
   maintaining reliability, transparency, and interoperability.

   Figure 1: The LLM-Assisted Network Management Framework

   The proposed framework is shown in Figure 1, highlighting the key
   components of LLM-assisted network management.  The human operator
   can generate a specific task agent, e.g., fault analysis or topology
   optimization, using the task agent management module.  According to
   the task type, the task agent module can instantiate a task agent
   with specific foundation model, prompt, and adaptation fine-tuned
   parameters[Hu22].  The enahnced telemetry module improves the
   semantics of raw telemetry data from original network management
   system, providing supplementary information to the LLM decision
   module for more informed decision-making.  After the decision-making,
   the generated configuration parameters are validated against the YANG
   model and enforced with access control rules.  The operator audit
   module provides a structured mechanism for human oversight of LLM-
   generated configurations, and the configuration can be issued to the
   original network management system for deployment once the operator
   approves.

3.1.  Enhanced Telemetry Module

   The Enhanced Telemetry Module improves the semantics of raw telemetry
   data, providing supplementary information to the LLM decision module
   for more informed decision-making.  Telemetry data retrieved from
   network devices via NETCONF[RFC6241], e.g., in XML format, often
   lacks field descriptions, structured metadata, and vendor-specific
   details.  Since this information is not included in the pre-trained
   knowledge of LLMs, it can lead to misinterpretation and erroneous
   reasoning.  To address this limitation, an external knowledge base
   should be introduced to store YANG model schema, device manuals, and
   other relevant documentation.  The Enhanced Telemetry Module
   functions as middleware between the network management system and the
   external knowledge base.  Through its southbound interface, it
   retrieves NETCONF data from the NETCONF client of existing network
   management system.  Through its northbound interface, the module
   queries the external knowledge base for the corresponding YANG model
   or device manual.  To enhance semantic richness, the Enhanced
   Telemetry Module processes the retrieved data by simplifying
   formatted content (e.g., removing redundant or closing XML tags) and
   appending XML path and description information from the YANG tree to
   the relevant fields.  This approach ensures that the LLM has access
   to structured, contextually enriched data, improving its ability to
   analyze and reason about network telemetry.

3.2.  LLM Decision Module

3.2.1.  RAG Module

   The pre-trained LLM may not encompass specific task requirements or
   vendor-specific knowledge.  To address this kind of limitation, the
   Retrieve-Augmented Generation (RAG)[Lewis20] approach is widely used.
   This module retrieves relevant information from operator-defined
   sources, such as device documentation and expert knowledge, and
   integrates it with the Enhanced Telemetry Module to obtain YANG model
   schema.  The retrieved textual data is stored in a database, either
   as raw text or in a vectorized format for efficient search and
   retrieval.  For a given task context, the module retrieves relevant
   knowledge from the database and incorporates it into the input
   context, improving the understanding and response accuracy of LLM.

3.2.2.  Task Agent Module

   To execute a specific task, such as traffic analysis, traffic
   optimization, or fault remediation, a corresponding task agent must
   be created.  A task agent consists of a selected LLM foundation
   model, an associated prompt, and fine-tuned weights.

   *  Foundation Model Library.  Operators must select an appropriate
      foundation model based on the specific task requirements.
      Examples include general-purpose models such as GPT-4, LLaMA, and
      DeepSeek, as well as domain-specific models fine-tuned on private
      datasets.  Since foundation models are trained on different
      datasets using varying methodologies, their performance may differ
      across tasks.

   *  Fine-Tuned Weight Library.  For domain-specific applications,
      fine-tuned weights can be applied on top of a foundation model to
      efficiently adapt it to private datasets.  One commonly used
      approach is to store the fine-tuned weights as the difference
      between the original foundation model and the adapted model, which
      can largely reduce storage requirements.  The Fine-Tuned Weights
      Module supports the selection and loading of an appropriate
      foundation model along with the corresponding fine-tuned weights,
      based on the selection of operators.  This ensures flexibility in
      leveraging both general-purpose and domain-specific knowledge
      while maintaining computational efficiency.

   *  Prompt Library.  For each task, it is essential to accurately
      define the task description, the format of its inputs and outputs.
      These definitions are stored in a structured prompt library.  When
      an operator instantiates a task, the corresponding prompt,
      including placeholders for contextual information, is
      automatically retrieved. operator inputs and device data are then
      incorporated into the prompt at the designated placeholders,
      ensuring a structured and consistent interaction with the language
      model.

   *  Tool Library.  Operators can specify the tools used for the task
      agent, such as a Python script or an API call.  These tools are
      stored in a tool library, and can be interacted with the agent via
      Model Context Prtocol (MCP)[mcp].

3.2.3.  Task Agent Management Module

   The Task Agent Management Module is responsible for the creation,
   update, and deletion of task agents.  This module ensures that each
   agent is appropriately configured to align with the intended network
   management objective.  Note that there can be multiple agents
   colloboratively to achieve the same objective.  In this scenario, the
   Task Agent Management Module can be used to coordinate the task
   agents, ensuring they are executed in a synchronized and efficient
   manner.  The agents can communicate with each other with the Agent-
   to-Agent Protocol (A2A)[a2a].

3.2.4.  Config Verify Module

   To ensure correctness and policy compliance, LLM-generated
   configurations MUST pass the YANG schema validation steps before
   being queued for human approval.  This module ensures that only
   syntactically correct configurations are presented for operator
   review, thereby reducing errors and enhancing network reliability.

3.2.5.  Access Control Module

   Although the Configuration Verify Module can guarantee the syntactic
   correction, LLMs may generate unintended or potentially harmful
   operations on critical network devices, it is essential for operators
   to enforce clear permission boundaries for LLM task agent to ensure
   security and operational integrity.  The Network Configuration Access
   Control Model defined in [RFC8341] provides a framework for
   specifying access permissions, which can be used to grant access to
   LLM task agents.  This data model includes the concepts of users,
   groups, access operation types, and action types, which can be
   applied as follows:

   *  User and Group: Each task agent should be registered as a specific
      user, representing an entity with defined access permissions for
      particular devices.  These permissions control the types of
      operations the LLM is authorized to perform.  A task agent (i.e.,
      user) is identified by a unique string within the system.  Access
      control can also be applied at the group level, where a group
      consists of zero or more members, and a task agent can belong to
      multiple groups.

   *  Access Operation Types: These define the types of operations
      permitted, including create, read, update, delete, and execute.
      Each task agent may support different sets of operations depending
      on its assigned permissions.

   *  Action Types: These specify whether a given operation is permitted
      or denied.  This mechanism determines whether an LLM request to
      perform an operation is allowed based on predefined access control
      rules.

   *  Rule List: A rule governs access control by specifying the content
      and operations a task agent is authorized to handle within the
      system.

   This module must enforce explicit restrictions on the actions an LLM
   is permitted to perform, ensuring that network configurations remain
   secure and compliant with operational policies.

3.3.  Operator Audit Module

   The Operator Audit Module provides a structured mechanism for human
   oversight of LLM-generated configurations before deployment.  The
   output from the LLM Decision Module should include both the generated
   configuration parameters and an associated confidence score.  The
   configuration parameters are validated for compliance with the YANG
   model and are subject to Access Control Rules enforcement.  The
   confidence score, e.g., ranging from 0 to 100, serves as a reference
   for operators to assess the reliability of the generated
   configuration.  Each audit process must track the input context
   (e.g., input data, RAG query content, model selection, configuration
   files) and the corresponding output results.  The auditing steps are
   as follows:

   *  Result Verification: The operator verifies the LLM-generated
      output to ensure alignment with business objectives and policy
      requirements.

   *  Compliance Check: The operator ensures that the LLM output adheres
      to regulatory standards and legal requirements.

   *  Security Verification: The operator examines the output for
      potential security risks, such as misconfigurations or
      vulnerabilities.

   *  Suggestions and Corrections: If issues are identified, the
      operator documents the findings and proposes corrective actions.

   Upon completing the audit, the system maintains an audit decision
   record to ensure traceability of operator actions.  The audit record
   includes the following information:

   *  Timestamp of the audit action

   *  LLM Task Agent ID associated with the action

   *  Operator decisions, including approval, rejection, modification,
      or pending status

   *  Executed command reflecting the final action taken

   *  Operation type (e.g., configuration update, deletion, or
      execution)

   This structured approach ensures that all LLM-generated
   configurations undergo rigorous human review, maintaining operational
   accountability, and security.

   The Operator Audit Module is enhanced with Explainability
   functionality to improve transparency and trust in LLM-assisted
   decision-making.  This enhancement ensures that operators can
   understand the reasoning behind LLM-generated configurations, verify
   their reliability, and take corrective actions when necessary.

   To achieve Explainability, the module provides a structured breakdown
   of the decision-making process by capturing key influencing factors,
   justification logs, and confidence scores.  Each LLM-generated
   configuration must include a detailed rationale explaining why a
   particular decision was made.  For example, if the system recommends
   increasing bandwidth allocation, the decision log should indicate
   whether this was due to high latency detected in telemetry, SLA
   thresholds being exceeded, or other contributing factors.

   Additionally, the audit process incorporates counterfactual analysis,
   allowing operators to assess alternative outcomes.  For instance, the
   system may indicate that if no action is taken, packet loss is
   expected to increase by 20% in the next ten minutes.  This capability
   enhances operational decision-making by providing a comparative
   assessment of different actions.

   To further ensure reliability, the module includes a mechanism to
   detect potential biases or hallucinations in LLM-generated outputs.
   If an LLM decision is based on incomplete or uncertain data, the
   system flags it accordingly, allowing operators to make informed
   judgments.  For example, if real-time telemetry data is insufficient,
   the system may indicate that the confidence in a particular
   recommendation is low.

   By integrating these Explainability features, the Operator Audit
   Module strengthens human oversight, ensuring that LLM-generated
   configurations align with business policies, security requirements,
   and regulatory standards.  This structured approach enhances
   accountability and mitigates risks associated with automated
   decision-making.

4.  Use Cases

4.1.  DDoS Intelligent Defense

   Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks remain a critical
   operational threat.  While conventional systems use rate-limiting and
   signature matching, they often fail to adapt in real-time or generate
   fine-grained filtering rules based on multi-dimensional telemetry
   data.

   This use case demonstrates how the LLM-assisted framework enables
   intelligent filtering rule generation and secure deployment with
   human oversight.

   1.  *Telemetry Collection and Semantic Enrichment* The Enhanced
       Telemetry Module retrieves real-time traffic statistics and
       interface metrics from network devices using NETCONF.  These raw
       telemetry data are semantically enriched by referencing YANG
       models and device-specific documentation to generate a context-
       rich dataset suitable for LLM processing.

   2.  *DDoS Filtering Task Instantiation* The operator initiates a
       ddos-mitigation task.  The Task Agent Module selects a security-
       specialized foundation model and task-specific prompt.

       It first analyzes the following conclusions: - Interface
       GigabitEthernet0/1 receiving sustained traffic > 100,000 pps -
       95% of incoming packets are TCP SYN - Top source prefixes
       identified as: IP1/24, IP2/24

       The RAG Module supplements the analysis with: - Cisco ACL syntax
       documentation - Prior incident response templates

   3.  *LLM-Generated Firewall Configuration Output* The LLM reasons
       that a TCP SYN flood is underway and generates the following ACL-
       based filtering policy:

   ip access-list extended BLOCK-DDOS
   deny tcp IP1 0.0.0.255 any
   deny tcp IP2 0.0.0.255 any
   permit ip any any

   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
   ip access-group BLOCK-DDOS in

   This configuration includes both source-based filtering and a global
   SYN rate-limiter.  It is passed to the Config Verify Module for
   syntax validation and to the Access Control Module for permission
   checks.

   1.  *Operator Audit and Decision* The Operator Audit Module provides
       the following metadata:

   *  *Task Agent ID*: ddos-mitigation-task-01

   *  *Confidence Score*: 85/100

   *  *RAG Context*: Cisco IOS ACL Syntax, Internal Threat List v5

   *  *Input Summary*:

      -  Affected Interface: GigabitEthernet0/1

      -  Malicious Sources: IP1/24, IP2/24

   The human operator performs the audit with the following steps:

   *  *Result Verification*: ACL syntax matches Cisco IOS 15.6
      standards.

   *  *Compliance Check*: Confirmed that both prefixes appear in the
      enterprise blacklist.

   *  *Security Review*: Low false-positive risk for blanket deny of SYN
      traffic from identified prefixes.

   *  *Audit Record*:

      -  Timestamp: 2025-07-16T17:03:00Z

      -  Decision: _Approved_

      -  Action: Apply via NMS interface

      -  Operator Note: “Confirmed match with active threat list.
         Monitor for collateral traffic drops.”

   The configuration is deployed through the network management system,
   completing the defense workflow with human oversight and
   traceability.

   This simplified case shows how the LLM can assist in quickly
   generating actionable filtering rules in response to DDoS patterns,
   while adhering to operational safeguards.

4.2.  Traffic Scheduling and Optimization

   In large-scale networks, dynamic traffic scheduling is required to
   adapt to fluctuating loads, ensure QoS, and meet SLA requirements.
   Traditional methods may lack responsiveness or cross-domain
   visibility.

   The proposed framework enables intelligent, context-aware traffic
   scheduling through LLM-based reasoning.  The following illustrates
   the process:

   1.  *Telemetry Data Acquisition* The Enhanced Telemetry Module
       gathers link utilization, queue occupancy, and delay metrics from
       multiple routers.  The semantic enrichment process tags each
       metric with human-readable labels from the YANG model, including
       path topology and policy tags (e.g., gold/silver/bronze service
       classes).

   2.  *Optimization Task Execution* An operator initiates a traffic
       scheduling task.  The Task Agent Module selects a foundation
       model fine-tuned on traffic engineering datasets and uses a
       structured prompt to describe current constraints: high
       utilization on core links L1-L3, SLA violations for gold-class
       VoIP traffic.

   3.  *Sample Configuration Output* The LLM suggests adjusting RSVP-TE
       path metrics to reroute gold traffic via underutilized backup
       paths:

   policy-options {
       policy-statement reroute-gold {
           term gold-traffic {
               from {
                   community gold-voip;
               }
               then {
                   metric 10;
                   next-hop [IP];
               }
           }
       }
   }
   protocols {
       rsvp {
           interface ge-0/0/0 {
               bandwidth 500m;
           }
       }
   }

   This configuration is syntax-validated and checked against the Access
   Control Module to ensure that traffic engineering policy updates are
   permitted for this task agent.

   1.  *Operator Audit and Decision* The Operator Audit Module presents:

   *  *Confidence Score*: 91/100

   *  *Audit Metadata*:

      -  Task Agent: traffic-opt-te-v2

      -  Input Context: “Link L1 (95% utilization), gold-voip SLA
         latency breach”

      -  Recommendation: “Increase TE path metric to reroute VoIP via L2
         backup path”

   The operator reviews:

   *  *Result Verification*: Simulates expected path shift via NMS.

   *  *Compliance Check*: Confirms SLA routing rules permit TE
      adjustment.

   *  *Security Review*: Confirms backup link L2 is secure and isolated.

   *  *Final Action*: _Approved with modification_: “Set bandwidth cap
      to 400m on backup to avoid overuse.”

   The revised configuration is stored and forwarded to the network
   management system for application.

   This use case illustrates how the framework enables LLMs to propose
   adaptive, policy-compliant traffic engineering strategies while
   maintaining operator control, traceability, and auditability.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   *  Model Hallucination: A key challenge is that, without proper
      constraints, the LLM may produce malformed or invalid
      configurations.  This issue can be mitigated using techniques such
      as Constrained Decoding, which enforces syntactic correctness by
      modeling the configuration syntax and restricting the output to
      conform to predefined rules during the generation process.

   *  Training Data Poisoning: LLMs can be trained on malicious or
      biased data, potentially leading to unintended behavior or
      security vulnerabilities.  To mitigate this risk, LLMs should be
      trained on curated, high-quality datasets with rigorous validation
      and filtering processes.  Periodic retraining and adversarial
      testing should also be conducted to detect and correct anomalies
      before deployment.

Appendix

Appendix A.1 Data Model

   This section defines the essential data models for LLM-assisted
   network management, including the LLM decision response and human
   audit records.

LLM Response Data Model

   The LLM decision module should respond with the generated
   configuration parameters along with an associated confidence score.
   If the LLM is unable to generate a valid configuration, it should
   return an error message accompanied by an explanation of the issue.

   module: llm-response-module
     +--rw llm-response
        +--rw config?         string
        +--rw confidence?     uint64
        +--rw error-reason?   enumeration

   The LLM response YANG model is structured as follows:

   module llm-response-module {
     namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-nmrg-llmn4et";
     prefix llmresponse;
     container llm-response {
       leaf config {
         type string;
       }
       leaf confidence {
         type uint64;
       }
       leaf error-reason {
         type enumeration {
           enum unsupported-task;
           enum unsupported-vendor;
         }
       }
     }
   }

Human Audit Data Model

   This data model defines the structure for human audit operations and
   record-keeping.  It facilitates collaborative decision-making by
   allowing LLMs to generate actionable insights while ensuring that
   human operators retain final operational authority.

   module: human-audit-module
     +--rw human-audit
        +--rw task-id?      string
        +--rw generated-config?   string
        +--rw confidence?         int64
        +--rw human-actions
           +--rw operator?          string
           +--rw action?            enumeration
           +--rw modified-config?   string
           +--rw timestamp?         yang:date-and-time

   The human audit YANG model is structured as follows:

   module human-audit-module {
     namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-nmrg-llmn4et";
     prefix llmaudit;
     import ietf-yang-types { prefix yang; }

     container human-audit {
       leaf task-id {
         type string;
         }
       leaf generated-config {
         type string;
         }
       leaf confidence {
         type int64;
         }
       container human-actions {
         leaf operator {
           type string;
           }
         leaf action {
           type enumeration {
             enum approve;
             enum modify;
             enum reject;
             }
           }
         leaf modified-config {
           type string;
           }
         leaf timestamp {
           type yang:date-and-time;
           }
       }
     }
   }
